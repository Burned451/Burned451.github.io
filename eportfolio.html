				<h3>
					Week 2 - Teamwork
				</h3>
				<p>
					When my high school introduced their first 3D printer, I felt I had to try it out. I spent nearly a year studying how to model and print objects with this new groundbreaking piece of technology. Near the end of the 11th grade, I was given an assignment from my physics class to construct a speaker from scratch. I found a partner who shared my interests and ideas, and together we worked after hours to create the school's first 3D printed physics project. The result worked better than expected, and was highly praised by the science department. Our end product is being displyed in the school to this day. My willingness to innovate and try new things is going to take me far in the future because it allows me to think outside the box and achieve the goal in ways that have never been done before by others.
