					<h3>
						Week 1 - Initiative
					</h3>
					<div class="img-p-wrapper">
						<img src="images/eportfolio/eportfolio_award.jpg" class="eportfolio-images">
						<p>
							When high school came around, I was assigned the task to earn 40 hours of volunteer work before I graduate. To achieve this, I partnered with my sister's gymnastics training program to find a position in their set-up and clean-up crew. After a few years, not only did I reach the 40 hour requirement, but I greatly esceeded it by helping out wherever possible. For my effort and initiative, I was awarded the 'Volunteer Appreciation' award that year which helped me stand out from all other volunteers. I continued to use this award as a selling point on my resume when I was applying for summer jobs, and I can see it being used as a notable accomplishment in the future.
						</p>
						<p>
							I chose this award because it is a perfect example of how I worked hard to achieve something great. When I began volunteering at the gymnastics program, I had no clue they would give out awards to their favourite volunteers; I worked hard for the sole purpose of making a positive impact on the community. The award also acts like a timepiece that forever represents the opportunity I took that managed to take me very far in my academic career.

						Week 2 - Teamwork
					</h3>

						<p>
							When my high school introduced their first 3D printer, I felt I had to try it out. I spent nearly a year studying how to model and print objects with this new groundbreaking piece of technology. Near the end of the 11th grade, I was given an assignment from my physics class to construct a speaker from scratch. I found a partner who shared my interests and ideas, and together we worked after hours to create the school's first 3D printed physics project. The result worked better than expected, and was highly praised by the science department. Our end product is being displyed in the school to this day. My willingness to innovate and try new things is going to take me far in the future because it allows me to think outside the box and achieve the goal in ways that have never been done before by others.
						</p>
						<p>
							I chose this artifact for two main reasons: it brought my teammate and I closer together, and it became a milestone in 3D printing at my high school. The partner I chose for the project went on to be a partner I regularly selected for future assingments because we worked like a dynamic duo. Additionally, after I showed off what can be accomplished with the 3D printer, I noticed a huge spike in interest for 3D printing in my school. After about a sememster, many more students were printing their own unique assignments as well. I felt very proud of myself for leaving something for the school to remember me by, even after I've graduated.

						Week 3 - Work Ethic
					</h3>
					<div class="img-p-wrapper">
						<img src="images/eportfolio/eportfolio_model.jpg" class="eportfolio-images">
						<p>
							Another artfifact that displays my 3D printing skills is a model I made of my high school during my senior year. After creating a very rough print of the school during an open house event I hosted, I decided to kick it up a notch by taking tens of hours out of my work week to refine my modelling skills and create an extra-detailed version of the same school model. While handling my academic life, I was also measuring and drawing the school in digital form with every door and stair accurate to the real thing. By the end of it, I had a perfect souvenir for the school's principal who was retiring that year, and a refined ability to balance several tiem consuming tasks.
						</p>
						<p>
							I found this artifact to be so memorable because of how proud I was at the end for completing it. This personal project had to be worked on concurrently with school projects, but that didn't stop me from getting everything done on time. Because of my history of poorly prioritizing work and entertainment, this example proves to me I might still have the ability to multitask in me. Furthermore, the final product turned out looking so much better than expected, which is why I like to look back at it for motivation to complete similar projects, and even use it to show off a little.

						Week 5 - Determination
					</h3>
					<div class="img-p-wrapper">
						<img src="images/eportfolio/eportfolio_game.jpg" class="eportfolio-images">
						<p>
							When the final month of the final year of high school came around, I put my time management skills to the test by volunteering to produce the annual graduation video. By sacrificing multiple days of my Study time during exam season, I was able to film and edit an 8 minute short film that was shown to all graduates at the ceremony. Taking this much time out of an already stressful period did a great job trainging me for similar events in the future; whether that is University exams, or a really time-consuming project assigned in the far future of my professional life.
						</p>
						<p>
							The artifact in the picture above is the cover of a fake video game based off of my high school, which was the main premise of the video. This is the best representation of the final product I have due to strict rules from the school's department to keep it confidential. Either way, I felt as if this artifact is appropriate for the skill because not only is it the most stressful projects I volunteered for, but I also surprisingly enjoyed the creation process and the presentation. Having my work be displayed in front of hundreds of students and parents is a privilege I never thought I would get.
