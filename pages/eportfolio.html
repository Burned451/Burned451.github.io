			Computer Club Head - Programming & Leadership
			<span class="subtitle">
				07/09/2017, Club
			</span>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Becoming the head of the computer science club at my high school was my own decision. Ever since I began attending the weekly meetups in my second year, I’ve always wanted to give back to the club by taking the place of my club instructors. In my final year of high school, once I became the head, it was my responsibility to organize lessons, teach them to the club goers and provide extra help to any students who feel they are falling behind in the material. I did just that; I researched interesting programming topics and made them into PowerPoint presentations which I went over during the weekly club meetings. As a result, I received praise from the computer science department and my efforts have been commemorated by the photograph (as shown above) that was taken by the school to insert into the yearbook. The programming knowledge I gained will be useful towards any job in that industry, while the leadership skills will beneficial for any management position where I might need to train or instruct a group of employees.

			Reddit Redesign - Web Development & Teamwork
			<span class="subtitle">
				12/01/2019, Hobby

		</h3>
		<p>
			The idea of working on my web development skills by redesigning existing websites (such as Reddit) has been with me for a long time, however, after another Reddit user with a similar idea wanted to start a new redesign project, I gladly joined their team. As a two-man team, we wrote a custom stylesheet for a basic Reddit page in order to modify it so that it incorporates some modern design elements. By communicating with my partner through social media, we added our own snippets of code to the stylesheet one-by-one until we agreed upon a final product. The project is close to but not yet complete (as shown above), but when both of us are satisfied with our work, we will submit our work to a Reddit community which will rate it and implement it into their own work. This project helped expand my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as the environments they run in. If I pursue a web development career or hobby, this knowledge will be essential in helping me transform databases into something more web/user friendly. Furthermore, this unusual approach to teamwork helped me understand how to collaborate with others online, when meeting them in person isn’t an option.

<h3>
	Week 3 - Work Ethic
</h3>
<div class="img-p-wrapper">
	<img src="images/eportfolio/eportfolio_model.jpg" class="eportfolio-images">
	<p>
		Another artfifact that displays my 3D printing skills is a model I made of my high school during my senior year. After creating a very rough print of the school during an open house event I hosted, I decided to kick it up a notch by taking tens of hours out of my work week to refine my modelling skills and create an extra-detailed version of the same school model. While handling my academic life, I was also measuring and drawing the school in digital form with every door and stair accurate to the real thing. By the end of it, I had a perfect souvenir for the school's principal who was retiring that year, and a refined ability to balance several tiem consuming tasks.
	</p>
	<p>
		I found this artifact to be so memorable because of how proud I was at the end for completing it. This personal project had to be worked on concurrently with school projects, but that didn't stop me from getting everything done on time. Because of my history of poorly prioritizing work and entertainment, this example proves to me I might still have the ability to multitask in me. Furthermore, the final product turned out looking so much better than expected, which is why I like to look back at it for motivation to complete similar projects, and even use it to show off a little.

	Week 4 - Communication
</h3>
<div class="img-p-wrapper">
	<img src="images/eportfolio/eportfolio_club.jpg" class="eportfolio-images">
	<p>
		For my last year in high school, I decided to give the knowledge of computer science back to department that taught me by becoming the head of the computer science club. Every Thursday throughout the school year, I would help lecture to the club and assist computer science students with academic or personal programming projects. By the end, I was well recognized by the department and my efforts were saved with a photograph of the club that was added to the yearbook. I believe this accomplishment is another detail I can state in a resume or job interview as a quick example of my passion for computer science and my ability to present ideas in front of a large group of people.
	</p>
	<p>
		I found this photograph to be so memorable because it is a time capsule I can look back at whenever I want to remind myself of how my computer science career all started, and the friends and staff that I got to experience it with. There are multiple friends I made during my high school years that I might not have known at all if I didn't pursue the subject the whole time I was there. For this reason, I purchased the overpriced yearbook just so that I can have a physical version of my favourite memories that might last me for decades to come.

	Week 5 - Determination
</h3>
<div class="img-p-wrapper">
	<img src="images/eportfolio/eportfolio_game.jpg" class="eportfolio-images">
	<p>
		When the final month of the final year of high school came around, I put my time management skills to the test by volunteering to produce the annual graduation video. By sacrificing multiple days of my Study time during exam season, I was able to film and edit an 8 minute short film that was shown to all graduates at the ceremony. Taking this much time out of an already stressful period did a great job trainging me for similar events in the future; whether that is University exams, or a really time-consuming project assigned in the far future of my professional life.
	</p>
	<p>
		The artifact in the picture above is the cover of a fake video game based off of my high school, which was the main premise of the video. This is the best representation of the final product I have due to strict rules from the school's department to keep it confidential. Either way, I felt as if this artifact is appropriate for the skill because not only is it the most stressful projects I volunteered for, but I also surprisingly enjoyed the creation process and the presentation. Having my work be displayed in front of hundreds of students and parents is a privilege I never thought I would get.
